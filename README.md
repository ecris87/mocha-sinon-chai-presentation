# Unit Testing the Frontend with Mocha, Sinon and Chai
This presentation aims to quickly explain some of the key concepts from the
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework as well as concepts from the [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) mocking 
framework and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) assertion library.

Examples are written with a Backbone application in mind but the overall concepts are framework-agnostic so hopefully 
they are easy to follow.

Companion piece to [Unit Testing the Frontend](https://github.com/ecris87/frontend-unit-testing-presentation), a 
presentation about why we should write unit tests for our frontend code.
